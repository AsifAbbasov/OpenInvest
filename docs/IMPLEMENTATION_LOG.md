This log is the index of implementation stages. Every stage must document its purpose, scope, decisions, completed work, verification, known risks, and recommended next step. At the end of each stage, implementation stops for a user-facing report and confirmation before any push.

| Stage | Purpose | Status | Report |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — Foundation | Establish a reproducible, architecture-aligned repository skeleton | Complete | [Stage 0 report](stages/STAGE_00_FOUNDATION.md) |
| 1 — Documentation Consolidation | Establish the repository-owned Source of Truth and freeze v1.2 | Complete; awaiting review | [Stage 1 report](stages/STAGE_01_DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION.md) |

## Stage completion protocol

1. Finish only the approved stage scope.
2. Run checks proportionate to the changes.
3. Update this log and the stage report.
4. Report created or changed files, commands, checks, risks, and the recommended next step.
5. Stop and request explicit confirmation before commit/push or the next stage when required.
